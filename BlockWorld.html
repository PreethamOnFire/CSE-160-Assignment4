                Notes for Graders<br>
                I just finished watching the show Severance and I thought it be fun to try and design my blocky world to look
                like the severed floor on Severance. I tried making the office to be basic and maze like to reflect how the office 
                was in the show.  <br>
                
                Features: <br>
                You can control the camera using the mouse and use WASD to move. E and Q can also rotate the camera.
                You can place blocks using middle mouse button and break blocks using left click. You can only break and place wall blocks.<br>
                I created a simple object loader that assumes that the faces are all triangles. I modeled a simple desk in blender
                and exported it as a obj file. I loaded it into the world and you can find that desk model around the world. You can
                find the obj file in the repo. <br>

                Also I do have colors and textures working together. The sky box is a blue box and there is hallway that is a black hallway.
